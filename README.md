# MarsChallenge
For this assigment, we were tasked with scraping Mars climate data. In part one, we created an instance of Beautiful Soup to analyse a news article about Mars. We created a dictionary out of the website information. Then in part 2, we used Beautiful Soup to scrape Mars temperature facts. The data was placed into a DataFrame with columns for transmission number, earth date, martian days, solar longitude, martian month, minimum temperature, and atmospheric pressure. We created three visualizations, one bar chart showing the average daily temperature for all the months, another bar chart to show the average daily atmospheric pressure for all the months, and a plot that shows the daily minimum temperature per earth year. Finally, the dataframe was exported into a csv file.
